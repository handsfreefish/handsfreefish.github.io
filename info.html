I&apos;d start with a Triton Professional Water Analysis test ( $49.). This will give you a good baseline assessment of what, if anything is out whack with Triton&apos;s NSW-derived matrix of trace element ranges. Only when you know if there is something that needs to be corrected should you attempt to correct it! That&apos;s the backbone of Triton&apos;s method. You will receive a detailed report of your water analysis, and specific recommendations on how to deal with any excesses or deficiencies of trace elements based on Triton&apos;s matrix. You may find that you need to do very little, or that perhaps you have higher than NSW limits on some things, in which case it doesn&apos;t take much to get where you want to go.</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/">If you elect to follow Triton&apos;s methodology of maintaining tight control of variables, you&apos;d probably want to consider utilizing the Triton &quot;Base Elementz&quot; balanced ionic solutions daily. This is essentially a 4-part additive set consisting of an alkalinity component, a calcium component, and a major and minor trace element component. Part 1 is in granular form while parts 2, 3A and 3B are liquids each contained in 1 liter bottles. Mix part 2, 3A and 3B with 9 liters of RO/DI water each and always keep them seperate. Then mix part 1 into its own solution of RO/DI water to match the volume of the other 3 solutions. The amount of RO water needed to match the other 3 containers is approx 9.66 liters. (although part 3a and part 3B can be combined into a single 8 liters of RO/DI water to create a combined 10 liters of solution, the high concentration of elements present in the solution can possibly crystalize within the dosing tubes of some dosing equipment making for increased hardware maintenance. For this reason only, it is recommended to keep all four parts seperate. If dosing them seperate you should end up with 4x 10liter stock solutions. What is more important than diluting to create exactly 10 liters, is that all four parts are of the same dilution. Since you will be dialing the dosing ml&apos;s pr day to achieve a stable daily alkalinity of 8 dkh, it is more important that all solutions are of the same volume.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/"><br></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/">Prior to starting with the Base Elementz, the carbonate hardness (alkalinity) of your aquarium should be measured and, if necessary, slowly adjusted to reach 8 DKH . As a starting dose, Triton recommends a dose of 10 ml of each of the four parts of Elementz solutions per 100 l of tank capacity every day. This is optimized by use of an automatic doser with 4 seperate channels. Be sure to add the elements individually and at different places in the tank, in order to prevent the agents from reacting with one another. Continue testing for carbonate hardness on a daily basis. If it increases, reduce the quantity of each Elementz solution. If the hardness decreases, slowly increase the quantity added. Measure carbonate hardness every day until it remains constant; once this has occurred, you have arrived at your individual dosage of Elementz.</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/">So...you would need a four channel dose, or 4 single channel doses to really dial things in.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/"><br></a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/">The management of your trace element levels is more easily accomplished with continued tests during the first couple of months- so you&apos;d probably want to start with a three test pack..One for &quot;before&quot;, one to see the results of your initial &quot;Elementz&quot; dose, and the last to monitor how things have settled in. Thereafter, much less frequent testing is okay...Although in a perfect world, I&apos;d do once a month.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="f16"><a href="https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/how-2-start-triton.192464/">So, so much more in terms of the nuances and schuss, but the actual &quot;application&quot; of the &quot;method&quot; is really not difficult. It seems a bit intimidating at first, but it&apos;s actually pretty straightforward: You make changes based on the needs of your aquarium, and only adjust or supplement as testing dictates. No guessing...</a></span></p>
